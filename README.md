# Drone-Scanner-for-inventory-management-system
Inventories management is one of the significant challenges in the industrial field.  Optimization of process and utilization of recent technology is needed to ease  inventory management. Currently, racks in warehouses can be stacked up to a 12- meter ceiling. As a result, it is impossible to scan inventory QR codes in some  warehouses unless forklifts and ladders are used. This may lead to safety risk, time, and human error. In this project, these problems will be addressed using an integrated  system consisting of a data collection drone and software to organize this data in a  structured way. The framework is expected to perform a QR scan and send the data  to the dashboard, where it is analyzed and organized to suit the client, where it can be  adopted quickly in their warehouses
